## Summary of Project 
- Problem Definition (Boston house price data).

- Loading the Dataset

- Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).

- Evaluate Algorithms (Linear Regression looked good).

- Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN looked good).

- Algorithm Tuning (K=3 for KNN was best).

- Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good).

- Tuning Ensemble Methods (getting the most from Gradient Boosting).

- Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).
